In this step, you'll define the purpose of the new Snowflake account by selecting both the business domain and environment it represents. In a domain + environment multi-account strategy, each account corresponds to a specific domain-environment combination (e.g., Sales-Dev, Finance-Prod).

**Account Context:** This step should be executed from your Organization Account.

## Why is this important?

In a domain + environment strategy:
- Each account represents a specific domain-environment combination
- This provides the strongest isolation (both between domains AND environments)
- Production data is completely separated from development
- Cost allocation at the account level is by both domain and environment

## External Prerequisites

- Platform Foundation workflow completed with Domain + Environment Multi-Account strategy
- Knowledge of which domain and environment combination this account will serve

## Key Concepts

**Domain + Environment Account Strategy**
Each Snowflake account represents a specific combination of business domain and SDLC environment. This is the most granular multi-account approach, providing maximum isolation.

**Domain**
The business unit or functional area (e.g., Sales, Finance, HR).

**Environment**
The SDLC stage (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod).

**Account Granularity**
With this strategy, you'll have accounts like:
- Sales-Dev, Sales-Test, Sales-Prod
- Finance-Dev, Finance-Test, Finance-Prod
- etc.

### Configuration Questions

#### Which domain will this account represent? (`account_domain`: single-select)
**What is this asking?**
Select the business domain this account will represent. This account will serve all environments (Dev, Test, Prod) for this domain.

**Why does this matter?**
- The domain becomes part of the account name
- Cost allocation at the account level will be attributed to this domain
- All resources in this account are associated with this domain

**Note on Environments:**
Since you're using a domain-based strategy, environments (Dev, Test, Prod) will be organized **within** this account at the database level. You'll configure environments when creating data products.

**More Information:**
* [Managing Accounts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations-manage-accounts) — Account management overview

#### Which environment will this account represent? (`account_environment`: single-select)
**What is this asking?**
Select the SDLC environment this account will represent. This account will serve all domains (Sales, Finance, HR, etc.) for this environment.

**Why does this matter?**
- The environment becomes part of the account name
- Cost allocation at the account level will be attributed to this environment
- All resources in this account are associated with this environment

**Environment Considerations:**
- **DEV/DEVELOPMENT**: Lower security, experimentation allowed
- **TEST/QA**: Moderate security, controlled changes
- **PROD/PRODUCTION**: Highest security, strict change control

**Note on Domains:**
Since you're using an environment-based strategy, domains will be organized **within** this account at the database level. You'll configure domains when creating data products.

#### Provide a brief description of this account's purpose. (`account_description`: text)
**What is this asking?**
Write a short description that explains what this account is for.

**Why does this matter?**
A clear description helps team members understand the account's purpose at a glance. It appears in account listings and documentation, making governance and auditing easier.

**Examples:**
- "Sales domain account - contains all environments for Sales analytics"
- "Finance domain account for financial reporting and analytics"
- "HR domain account for people analytics and workforce planning"

#### What prefix (if any) should be added to all account names? (`account_name_prefix`: text)
An account name prefix is an optional string added to the beginning of every account name for consistency and organization identification.  

**When to use a prefix:**  
* If your organization name is system-generated (e.g., `XY12345`) and you want your company name visible in account names  
* If you want to enforce consistent naming across all accounts  
* If you have multiple organizations or business units sharing Snowflake and need differentiation  

**Example with prefix:**  
* Prefix: `acme`  
* Account names become: `acme_prod`, `acme_dev`, `acme_finance`  
* URL: `https://XY12345-acme_prod.snowflakecomputing.com`  

**Example without prefix:**  
* Account names: `prod`, `dev`, `finance`  
* URL: `https://ACME-prod.snowflakecomputing.com`  

**Recommendations:**  
* If you have a **custom organization name** (like `ACME`), a prefix is typically unnecessary since your identity is already in the URL  
* If you have a **system-generated name**, consider using an abbreviated company name as a prefix  
* Keep prefixes short (3-8 characters) with no underscores  

**Enter `NONE` if you do not want to use an account name prefix.**

#### What core component ordering will be used for account-level object names? (`object_component_order`: single-select)
**Why Order Matters:**  
Snowflake displays objects alphabetically. The component order determines how objects cluster together in Snowsight, BI tools, and queries.  

**Option 1: `<domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>`**  
* Objects cluster by **domain first**, then by environment  
* All Finance objects together, all Marketing objects together  
* Example: `FIN_PROD_ANALYTICS`, `FIN_DEV_ANALYTICS`, `MKT_PROD_CAMPAIGNS`  
* Best for: Organizations where domain ownership is primary  

**Option 2: `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>`**  
* Objects cluster by **domain first**, then by data product  
* All Finance Analytics together across environments  
* Example: `FIN_ANALYTICS_PROD`, `FIN_ANALYTICS_DEV`, `MKT_CAMPAIGNS_PROD`  
* Best for: Data product-centric organizations  

**Option 3: `<env>_<domain>_<dataproduct>`**  
* Objects cluster by **environment first**  
* All Production objects together, all Development objects together  
* Example: `PROD_FIN_ANALYTICS`, `PROD_MKT_CAMPAIGNS`, `DEV_FIN_ANALYTICS`  
* Best for: Operations teams focused on environment-based management  

**Recommendation:** Most organizations prefer `<domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>` or `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>` for domain-centric clustering.  

**More Information:**  
* [Object Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers)  
**Options:**
- <domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>
- <domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>
- <env>_<domain>_<dataproduct>

#### What is your Snowflake organization name? (`snowflake_org_name`: text)
Your Snowflake organization name is the first part of your account URL and connection identifiers. This is a required component of all Account Identifiers.  
  **How to find your organization name:**  
  Look at your current Snowflake URL. The organization name is the portion before the dash:  
  * https://\*\*ACME\*\*-prod.snowflakecomputing.com → Organization name is ACME  
  * https://\*\*XY12345\*\*-prod.snowflakecomputing.com → Organization name is XY12345  
* **Types of Organization Names:**  
  * **Custom Name:** A human-readable name like ACME or INITECH that was requested from Snowflake. These provide better branding and more readable URLs.  
  * **System-Generated:** An auto-assigned alphanumeric code like XY12345 or AB98765, created automatically during self-service sign up. Companies typically keep this name if transparency of your organization name in the URL is unnecessary or undesirable.   
* **To request a custom name:** If you have a system-generated name and want to change it, [contact Snowflake Support](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-To-Submit-a-Support-Case-in-Snowflake-Lodge) or your account team. Custom names must be globally unique, start with a letter, and contain only letters and numbers.

#### What account strategy do you wish to implement? (`account_strategy`: single-select)
Choose the account strategy that best fits your organization. Your choice determines how domain (business unit/entity) and environment are organized:  
  **Single Account:**  
  * Best for: Small to medium organizations, centralized teams, simpler governance  
  * Naming: Domain \+ Environment \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Lower operational overhead, easier cross-database queries, centralized management  
  * Cons: Less isolation, shared resource limits, single security boundary  
  * Recommendation: Consider setting up an organization account even for single-account deployments to enable future growth  
* **Multi-Account (Environment-based):**  
  * Best for: Organizations requiring strong environment isolation (dev/test/prod)  
  * Naming: Environment at account level, Domain \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Complete environment isolation, independent security controls, separate billing  
  * Cons: More complex data sharing, higher operational overhead  
  * Requirement: Organization account required  
* **Multi-Account (Domain-based):**  
  * Best for: Large enterprises with autonomous business units/domains  
  * Naming: Domain at account level, Environment \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Clear cost allocation per domain, independent governance, domain autonomy  
  * Cons: Higher complexity, requires data sharing for cross-domain analytics  
  * Requirement: Organization account required  
* **Multi-Account (Domain \+ Environment):**  
  * Best for: Large organizations needing both domain and environment isolation  
  * Naming: Domain \+ Environment at account level, Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Maximum isolation, clear ownership and environment separation  
  * Cons: Highest complexity and operational overhead, most accounts to manage  
  * Requirement: Organization account required
