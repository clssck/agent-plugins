In this step, you'll define the schemas within each zone. Schemas organize related tables, views, and other objects within a database. Each schema will have its own set of database roles for granular access control.

For each schema you define, the following database roles will be created:
- `SC_R_<schema>` — Read access to the schema
- `SC_W_<schema>` — Write access to the schema
- `SC_C_<schema>` — Create access to the schema

**Account Context:** This is a planning step. Schemas are created in Task 2.

## Why is this important?

Schema organization provides:
- **Logical Grouping**: Related objects are grouped together
- **Fine-grained Access**: Different schemas can have different access policies
- **Namespace Management**: Prevents naming conflicts within a database
- **Governance**: Schemas can represent different subject areas or data sources

## Prerequisites

- Zone structure configured (Step 1.3)
- Understanding of your data sources and subject areas

## Key Concepts

**Schema Naming Patterns**

| Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| By Source | `SAP`, `SALESFORCE`, `STRIPE` | Clear data lineage from source systems |
| By Subject Area | `CUSTOMERS`, `ORDERS`, `PRODUCTS` | Business-oriented organization |
| By Team | `MARKETING`, `FINANCE`, `OPS` | Team-based ownership |
| Functional | `STAGING`, `CORE`, `REPORTING` | Processing stage within a zone |

**Schema Access Roles (Database Roles)**

Each schema gets three database roles following a hierarchy:

```
SC_R_<schema> (Read)
    ↑
SC_W_<schema> (Write) - inherits Read
    ↑
SC_C_<schema> (Create) - inherits Write and Read
```

These schema-level roles roll up to database-level roles:
- `SC_R_*` → `DB_R`
- `SC_W_*` → `DB_W`
- `SC_C_*` → `DB_C`

**Managed Access Schemas**
All schemas are created with `MANAGED ACCESS`, meaning:
- Object owners cannot grant access to their objects
- Only the schema owner (ADMIN role) can manage grants
- Ensures centralized access control

### Configuration Questions

#### What is the name of this data product? (`data_product_name`: text)
**What is this asking?**
Provide a descriptive name for your data product. This name will be used in database names, role names, and resource tags.

**Why does this matter?**
The data product name is a key component of object naming:
- Databases: `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<zone>_<env>` (based on your naming convention)
- Roles: `<dataproduct>_owner`, `<dataproduct>_reader`
- Tags: `DATAPRODUCT = '<dataproduct>'`

A clear, descriptive name makes resources easy to identify and manage.

**Naming Guidelines:**
- Use lowercase, single words or concatenated words (no underscores)
- Underscores are reserved for separating naming components (domain, zone, env)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reflect the business purpose or use case
- Avoid technical jargon unless widely understood
- Avoid reserved words or special characters

**Examples:**
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `customer360` | Unified customer data and analytics |
| `salesanalytics` | Sales reporting and analysis |
| `supplychain` | Supply chain operations data |
| `finreporting` | Financial reporting and compliance |
| `marketing` | Marketing campaign attribution |
| `productcatalog` | Product information management |
| `inventory` | Inventory tracking and forecasting |

**Recommendation:**
Choose a name that business users would recognize. Ask: "If someone searched for this data, what would they type?"

#### Define the schemas for each zone in your data product. (`schema_configuration`: object-list)
**What is this asking?**
Define schemas for each zone in your data product. Each row represents one zone, and `schemas` is a comma-separated list of schema names that belong to that zone.

**Example Configuration:**

| Zone | Schemas |
|------|---------|
| RAW | SALESFORCE, SAP, STRIPE |
| CURATED | CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, PRODUCTS |
| CONSUMPTION | REPORTING, ANALYTICS |

**Field Descriptions:**
- **zone**: The data zone this entry applies to (e.g. RAW, CURATED, CONSUMPTION). Must match a zone defined in your data architecture.
- **schemas**: Comma-separated list of schema names for this zone (e.g. `SALESFORCE, SAP, STRIPE`). Each schema name should be uppercase and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent naming across zones
- Group by source system in RAW, by subject in CURATED
- Keep schema count manageable (2-5 per zone)


#### Define the data zones for your data product. (`data_zones`: object-list)
**What is this asking?**
Define each data zone (logical layer) for your data product. Zones represent 
stages in your data pipeline.

**Common Zone Patterns:**

**Three-Zone (Medallion):**
| Zone | Purpose | Time Travel |
|------|---------|-------------|
| RAW | Landing zone for source data | 1 day |
| CURATED | Cleansed and validated data | 7 days |
| CONSUMPTION | Business-ready analytics | 7 days |

**Four-Zone:**
| Zone | Purpose | Time Travel |
|------|---------|-------------|
| LANDING | Raw ingestion | 1 day |
| BRONZE | Light transformation | 1 day |
| SILVER | Business logic applied | 7 days |
| GOLD | Aggregated/consumption | 7 days |

**Why does this matter?**
- Each zone becomes a separate database
- Zone structure affects data lineage and access patterns
- Time travel settings impact storage costs

**Recommendation:** Start with 3 zones. You can add more later.
