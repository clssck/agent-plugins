# Inconsistencies Detection

## When to Load

Best Practices Audit Phase 2b.

## Detection Methodology

### Step 1: Build Cross-Reference Map

Create a comprehensive map of all components from the YAML:

1. **Column Registry** — Map all columns by name across all tables, tracking descriptions, data types, and classifications
2. **Relationship Registry** — Map all relationships, tracking foreign keys and join conditions
3. **Metric Registry** — Map all measures and aggregations, tracking calculation methods

### Step 2: Execute Detection Rules

#### 1. Column Inconsistencies

- **Conflicting descriptions for same column** (PRIORITIZE)
  - Example: `order_date` described differently across tables
  - Severity: MEDIUM

- **Same column name with different data types**
  - Example: `customer_id` is NUMBER in one table, VARCHAR in another
  - Severity: CRITICAL

- **Mixed dimension/measure classification**
  - Example: Column classified as both dimension and measure
  - Severity: HIGH

#### 2. Relationship Inconsistencies

- **Orphaned relationships** (references non-existent tables/columns)
  - Severity: CRITICAL

- **Circular dependencies**
  - Severity: HIGH

- **Conflicting join conditions** (same relationship defined differently)
  - Severity: HIGH

#### 3. Type Inconsistencies

- **Dimension used as measure elsewhere** — Severity: HIGH
- **Measure used as dimension elsewhere** — Severity: HIGH
- **Time dimension type mismatches** (date column not marked as time dimension) — Severity: MEDIUM

#### 4. Aggregation Inconsistencies

- **Same measure with different aggregation functions** — Severity: HIGH
- **Conflicting aggregation logic** — Severity: HIGH

#### 5. Filter Inconsistencies

- **Contradictory filter conditions** — Severity: CRITICAL
- **Overlapping filters with conflicts** — Severity: MEDIUM

### Step 3: Categorize by Severity

- **CRITICAL**: Will cause query failures or wrong results
- **HIGH**: Likely to cause confusion or unexpected behavior
- **MEDIUM**: May cause issues in specific scenarios
- **LOW**: Stylistic inconsistencies

## Output Format

For each inconsistency:

1. **Severity Level**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
2. **Detection Rule**: Which check detected it
3. **Issue Description**: What the inconsistency is
4. **Locations**: Where the conflicts occur
5. **Impact**: How this affects query results
6. **Resolution**: How to fix the issue
