Skills for working with Snowpark Connect for Spark (SCOS) on Snowflake — supports Python, Scala, and Java workloads.

## When to Use

- User wants to assess a PySpark or Databricks workload for SCOS compatibility (without committing to migration)
- User wants to migrate PySpark, Databricks, Spark Scala, or Spark Java code to Snowflake
- User asks about SCOS or Snowpark Connect compatibility
- User wants to validate a completed SCOS migration
- User mentions "spark connect", "scos", "snowpark connect", "assess spark", or "migration readiness"

## Intent Detection

Determine the **intent** first, then the **language**, then route:

  │     │     → Standalone Scala assessment is not yet available. Inform the user, then
  │     │       load migrate-spark-scala-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md — it produces a
  │     │       readiness report at Phase 1a before making any code changes; ask whether

```

**Assessment intent** — explore compatibility or effort without committing to migration:
assess, analyze, scan, audit, review for compatibility, check compatibility, check my spark,
understand my spark, evaluate, migration readiness, readiness report, migration effort,
how hard is migration, how complex, migration scope, before I migrate, should I migrate,
databricks to snowflake, pyspark to snowflake, can my spark run on snowflake, pre-migration.

**Migration / Validation intent** — start, continue, or verify a conversion:
migrate, convert, rewrite, update imports, move to SCOS, fix, validate, verify, resume migration.

### Step 1: Detect Language

Determine the source language from:
- **Explicit mention**: "PySpark", "Python Spark", "Scala Spark", "Java Spark", "Spark Java"
- **File extensions**: `.py` → Python; `.scala` → Scala; `.java` → Java
- **Import patterns**: `from pyspark` / `import pyspark` → Python; `import org.apache.spark` with `.scala` → Scala; `import org.apache.spark` in a `.java` file → Java
- **Build files**: `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python; `build.sbt` → Scala; `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` (without `.scala` files, or with `.java` files) → Java
- **Notebook primary language + cell distribution** (for notebook workloads):
  - For every notebook found by `notebook_io.scan_notebooks`, combine the
    notebook's primary `language` with a per-cell language count obtained from
    `notebook_io.parse_notebook`.
  - The **dominant language across all code cells** in the workload picks the
    migration sub-skill.

If the language cannot be determined, ask the user:
```
I detected Spark code in your workload. Which language is it written in?
- Python (PySpark / Databricks)
- Scala (Spark Scala)
- Java (Spark Java)
```

## Supported Notebook Formats

Both migration sub-skills process the following notebook formats natively via
the shared `scripts/notebook_io.py` module — no `jupyter nbconvert` required:

| Extension | Format                       | Notes                                         |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `.ipynb`  | Standard Jupyter JSON        | Typically pretty-printed; kernel language in metadata |
| `.python` | Databricks native JSON       | Python-primary; `commands[]` array            |
| `.scala`  | Databricks native JSON       | Scala-primary; first byte `{`                 |
| `.scala`  | Databricks exported text     | First line `// Databricks notebook source`    |
| `.sql`    | Databricks native JSON       | SQL-primary; routed to whichever language has more code cells |
| `.py`     | Databricks exported text     | First line `# Databricks notebook source`     |

`.dbc` archives are automatically unpacked in Phase 0 and their contents flow
through the same scanner.

## Cross-Language Delegation

Databricks notebooks routinely mix languages via `%python`, `%scala`, `%sql`
magic lines. When the fixer in one sub-skill encounters a cell whose
`cell_language` differs from the sub-skill's primary language, it delegates
the single cell to the sibling sub-skill's fixer via `task()` in
`CELL_MODE=true` — the delegated agent returns the transformed cell source as
text, and the caller splices it back into the notebook. Markdown, SQL, R,
shell, FS, and `%run` cells are left untouched.

See `migrate-*/agents/fixer.md` — "Cross-Language Delegation" and
"CELL_MODE" sections — for protocol details.

## Phase 6 Handoff (Standalone Mode Only)

After a successful migration in **standalone** invocation (not via the
`snowflake-migration` orchestrator), each sub-skill offers an optional
handoff to `snowflake-notebook-migration` to convert the migrated notebooks
to Snowflake Workspace `.ipynb` format. The offer is skipped entirely when:

- the invocation context carries `snowpark_connect_invoker: orchestrator`, or
- the `snowflake-notebook-migration` skill is not installed (in which case an
  informational note is printed and the sub-skill exits cleanly).

### Step 2: Route by Intent

**Migration intent** — keywords: migrate, convert, rewrite, update imports, move to SCOS
**Validation intent** — keywords: validate, verify, check, test, review migration

### Route: Migrate PySpark to Snowpark Connect

**If user wants to migrate Python Spark code:**
- **Load** `migrate-pyspark-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the migration workflow
- Uses EWI codes: `SPRKCNTPY*`
- References: `references/python/`

### Route: Migrate Spark Scala to Snowpark Connect

**If user wants to migrate Scala Spark code:**
- **Load** `migrate-spark-scala-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the migration workflow
- Uses EWI codes: `SPRKCNTSCL*`
- References: `references/scala/`

### Route: Migrate Spark Java to Snowpark Connect

**If user wants to migrate Java Spark code:**
- **Load** `migrate-spark-java-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the migration workflow
- Uses EWI codes: `SPRKCNTSCL*` (Java reuses the JVM/Scala family)
- References: `references/java/`

### Route: Validate a PySpark Migration

**If user wants to validate a completed Python migration:**
- **Load** `validate-pyspark-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the validation workflow

### Route: Validate a Spark Scala Migration

**If user wants to validate a completed Scala migration:**
- **Load** `validate-spark-scala-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the validation workflow

### Route: Validate a Spark Java Migration

**If user wants to validate a completed Java migration:**
- **Load** `validate-spark-java-to-snowpark-connect/SKILL.md`
- Follow the validation workflow

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

Every command this skill surfaces to the user runs on **macOS, Linux, and
Windows**. Follow the authoring rules in
`skill_development/references/cross-platform.md`
— specifically:

- **Primary entry point for every script: `uv run --project <SKILL_DIRECTORY> python <SKILL_DIRECTORY>/scripts/<name>.py`.**
  No `chmod`, no `source`, no activation — `uv` handles the venv on every OS.
- **Dual-install snippets for `uv` bootstrap** (see each `migrate-*`
  sub-skill's *uv Package Manager* section): show both the macOS/Linux
  `curl -LsSf … | sh` and the Windows PowerShell `irm … | iex` forms.
- **No user-facing Unix-only constructs**: `date +…`, `mkdir -p`,
  `cp -r`, `find -print0`, `xargs`, `$(…)` command substitution, raw
  `/tmp/` or `~/` paths. Use the portable Python helpers under `scripts/`
  instead:
  - `scripts/prepare_conversion_dirs.py` — timestamped folder + source copy + `.dbc` unpack
  - `scripts/revert_failing_files.py` — Phase-2 compile gate + git-revert + `__pycache__` cleanup
  - `scripts/run_scos_migration.py` — portable wrapper that ensures
    `generate_scos_reports.py` runs even when the migration agent is
    interrupted mid-workflow (replaces the deprecated `.sh`
    equivalent).
- **Sandbox-only bash is explicitly marked** with a comment
  `# Runs in the CoCo bash sandbox (Linux) — not portable` so readers
  know not to copy it into Windows `cmd.exe` or PowerShell.

When authoring new scripts or phases in this skill, pick the Python
helper-script pattern first. Fall back to the in-sandbox bash form only
when the work is genuinely bound to the CoCo Linux sandbox and rewriting
in Python would add disproportionate complexity — and even then, mark
the block with the sandbox comment above.

## Stopping Points

None — this skill routes to sub-skills. Stopping points are defined within each sub-skill.

## Output

Output is determined by the loaded sub-skill:
- **Python Migration**: Migrated `_scos` files with compatibility fixes, migration headers, and SCOS-compatible dashboard reports (`Reports/Issues.csv`, `Reports/InputFilesInventory.csv`, `Reports/ArtifactDependencyInventory.csv`) using `SPRKCNTPY*` codes
- **Scala Migration**: Migrated `_scos` files with compatibility fixes, migration headers, and SCOS-compatible dashboard reports using `SPRKCNTSCL*` codes
- **Java Migration**: Migrated `_scos` files with compatibility fixes, migration headers, and SCOS-compatible dashboard reports using `SPRKCNTSCL*` codes (JVM family)
- **Validation**: Validation report with pass/fail status for each check
