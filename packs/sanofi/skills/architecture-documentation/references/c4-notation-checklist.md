## 1. Cross-Level Consistency Checks

These checks ensure all C4 levels tell a coherent story.

### Naming Consistency

- [ ] The system name is identical across L1, L2, and L3 diagrams
- [ ] Container names in L2 match exactly when referenced in L3 boundary boxes
- [ ] External system names are identical across all levels where they appear
- [ ] Person/persona names are identical across all levels where they appear
- [ ] No synonyms used across levels (e.g., "User Service" in L1 and "Users API" in L2)

### Element Consistency

- [ ] Every container shown in L2 corresponds to the single system box in L1
- [ ] Every component shown in L3 belongs to a container shown in L2
- [ ] External systems in L2/L3 match those in L1
- [ ] No "orphan" elements appear in lower levels that are not traceable to higher levels
- [ ] People shown at L2/L3 are also present at L1

### Relationship Consistency

- [ ] High-level relationships in L1 are decomposed into specific container-level
      relationships in L2 (no relationship disappears when zooming in)
- [ ] Protocol labels at L2 are consistent with the technology labels on containers
- [ ] Direction of data flow is consistent across levels

---

## 2. C4 Notation Compliance

### Diagram Titles

- [ ] Every diagram has a title
- [ ] Title format: "{Diagram Type} for {System/Container/Scope Name}"
- [ ] Examples: "System Context diagram for User Platform",
      "Container diagram for User Platform",
      "Component diagram for User Platform API"
- [ ] The diagram can stand alone: a reader understands it without the surrounding narrative

### Legend / Key

- [ ] Every diagram has a legend in the bottom-right corner
- [ ] Legend explains all shapes used (Person, System, Container, Component)
- [ ] Legend explains all colors used (blue, grey, teal, etc.)
- [ ] Legend explains line styles (solid = synchronous, dashed = asynchronous)
- [ ] Legend explains any icons (AWS icons, etc.)
- [ ] Legend has a visible background box to distinguish it from diagram elements
- [ ] Mermaid C4 cannot render a legend: place the legend as text or a table adjacent to the diagram

### Element Labels

- [ ] Every element uses the 3-line label format:
      Line 1: **Name** (bold)
      Line 2: [Type: Technology]
      Line 3: Short description
- [ ] Names are concise but descriptive
- [ ] Type is explicitly stated (Person, Software System, Container, Component)
- [ ] Technology is specified for all containers and components
- [ ] Description provides an "at a glance" view of key responsibilities
- [ ] No element is unlabeled
- [ ] Acronyms and abbreviations (domain or technology) are understandable to the audience or explained in the legend

### Relationship Labels

- [ ] Every arrow has a label
- [ ] Labels use specific action verbs (NOT generic "Uses", "Calls", "Connects to")
- [ ] Good examples: "Reads user profiles from", "Sends order events to",
      "Authenticates via", "Stores uploaded files in"
- [ ] Bad examples: "Uses", "Calls", "Connects", "Interacts with"
- [ ] Labels are consistent with arrow direction (source -> target)

### Protocol Labels

- [ ] Container-level relationships include protocol/technology labels
- [ ] Format: "[HTTP/REST]", "[SQL/TCP]", "[gRPC]", "[AMQP]", "[SQS/HTTPS]"
- [ ] Protocol labels appear either on the relationship label or as a second line
- [ ] L1 (System Context) relationships do NOT have protocol labels (abstraction level)

### Arrow Styles

- [ ] All arrows are unidirectional (one arrowhead, showing data/control flow direction)
- [ ] No bidirectional arrows (use two separate arrows if needed)
- [ ] Solid lines = synchronous communication
- [ ] Dashed lines = asynchronous communication (queues, events, fire-and-forget)
- [ ] Dotted lines = dependencies (compile-time, structural -- use sparingly)

> **Note**: The C4 model is notation-independent regarding line styles. The solid/dashed/dotted
> convention above is a Sanofi standard for consistency across teams.

## 3. Abstraction Correctness

### SPA Modeling

- [ ] A browser SPA is modeled as a client-side container when it is within the
      documented system boundary.
- [ ] An API, asset host, or other server-side runtime is added only when it is a
      distinct in-scope responsibility; an external API is shown as an external system.
- [ ] Any SPA-to-API relationship that appears in the view is labeled with its actual
      protocol and direction.

### Cloud Services Rule

- [ ] AWS services your team owns/manages (S3 buckets, RDS instances, DynamoDB tables,
      ElastiCache clusters, SQS queues) are modeled as **containers** within your system
- [ ] Third-party cloud services you do not own are modeled as **external systems** (grey)
- [ ] Managed services (e.g., AWS Cognito for auth) may be external if you only consume them
- [ ] Each owned queue or topic is its own container; the message bus or broker is NOT a hub container
- [ ] A queue shared by separate software systems has a stated owner

### Not-a-Container Checks

- [ ] No JAR files, C# assemblies, or DLLs modeled as containers
- [ ] No npm packages or Python modules modeled as containers
- [ ] No Terraform modules modeled as containers
- [ ] No Dockerfiles modeled as containers (Dockerfiles are build artifacts, not runtime)
- [ ] No tools or frameworks modeled as containers (annotate as [Technology] on the container that uses them)

### Not-a-Component Checks

- [ ] No folders or directories modeled as components
- [ ] No namespaces or packages modeled as components
- [ ] No individual classes modeled as components (too granular -- belongs at L4)
- [ ] No config files or data models modeled as components
- [ ] No ports (inbound/outbound) modeled as components (ports are interfaces -- add as notes to containers instead)
- [ ] No tools or frameworks modeled as systems, containers, or components (annotate as comments on the element that uses them)

### Component Diagram Necessity

- [ ] L3 diagrams only exist for containers where they add genuine value
- [ ] Simple CRUD services do NOT have L3 diagrams
- [ ] Complex containers with significant internal architecture DO have L3 diagrams

---

## 4. Artifact Checks

### Readable Source and Render

- [ ] The chosen native artifact opens in the repository's supported tool or renders
      correctly in its intended destination.
- [ ] The source of truth, rendered output, attachment, and version identifier agree
      where more than one artifact is maintained.
- [ ] Existing Confluence macros, attachments, and page structure are preserved by the
      publishing workflow rather than rebuilt from a copied payload.

### Labels and Relationships

- [ ] Labels remain legible at the normal review size.
- [ ] Relationships, arrowheads, and boundaries remain distinguishable in the selected
      format and exported view.
- [ ] Special characters, links, and accessibility text render as intended.

## 5. Sanofi-Specific Checks

> **Note**: The C4 model is notation-independent regarding colors. The palette below is a
> Sanofi standard. The official C4 guidance: use any colors, but keep them consistent within
> and across diagrams, and consider accessibility.

### Color Palette

- [ ] Person elements and in-scope systems use the designated Sanofi blue treatment
- [ ] External systems use a visually distinct neutral treatment
- [ ] Containers and components use distinct, consistent visual treatments
- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast against its background
- [ ] Boundaries and arrows remain visible without relying on color alone
- [ ] Colors are distinguishable when printed in grayscale
- [ ] Color choices consider color blindness (avoid relying on red/green distinction alone)

### Naming Conventions

- [ ] Systems follow `[Product Name] System` pattern
- [ ] Containers follow `[System Name] [Container Type]` pattern
- [ ] Components follow `[Responsibility] [Component Type]` pattern
- [ ] Persons follow `[Role] [Optional: Organization]` pattern
- [ ] Logical artifact identifier: `{system-name}-L{level}-v{version}` with the
      repository's established extension or native format

### Metadata

- [ ] Confluence page includes full metadata table (System ID, owners, classification,
      status, compliance, technology stack, SLA, DR)
- [ ] All mandatory metadata fields are populated
- [ ] System ID matches the organization's APM/CMDB registry

### Description Templates

- [ ] System descriptions follow: "[System Name] provides [capability] to [users]..."
- [ ] Container descriptions follow: "[Container Name] is a [type] that provides..."
- [ ] Component descriptions follow: "[Component Name] is responsible for..."

## 6. Per-Level Review Checklists

### Context Diagram (L1) Review

- [ ] All key stakeholders and user personas identified
- [ ] System boundaries clearly defined (one system box)
- [ ] External dependencies documented (all grey boxes)
- [ ] Data flows indicated with correct directionality
- [ ] No technology details or protocols shown
- [ ] Business value clearly articulated in system description
- [ ] Consistent with enterprise architecture (if exists)
- [ ] Required metadata complete on Confluence page
- [ ] Scope is readable for the intended audience; group or split unrelated external
      systems when the context view becomes crowded

### Container Diagram (L2) Review

- [ ] All containers clearly labeled with technology
- [ ] Data stores identified with data classification
- [ ] User interfaces distinguished from APIs
- [ ] Security boundaries marked
- [ ] Integration patterns identified (sync/async)
- [ ] SPA client, API, and asset-host responsibilities are classified from actual
      in-scope runtimes rather than a fixed container rule
- [ ] In-scope cloud services modeled as containers; services merely consumed shown as external
- [ ] Consistent with context diagram (same system, same external systems)
- [ ] Protocol labels on all relationships
- [ ] The view remains readable; split by business area or create a supplementary view
      when it becomes crowded

### Component Diagram (L3) Review

- [ ] Component responsibilities clearly defined
- [ ] Interfaces explicitly documented
- [ ] Data access patterns identified
- [ ] Business logic separation evident
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns addressed (auth, logging)
- [ ] Consistent with container diagram (same container boundary)
- [ ] Other containers shown as context (grey/blue)
- [ ] The view includes only architecturally significant responsibilities; no fixed
      component count is required

### Deployment Diagram Review

- [ ] Deployment nodes labeled with infrastructure type
- [ ] The diagram covers exactly one deployment environment, named in the title
- [ ] Container instances mapped to correct deployment nodes
- [ ] Scaling information noted (replicas, auto-scaling)
- [ ] Network boundaries and security groups shown
- [ ] Load balancers and routing shown
- [ ] AWS region and AZ information included
- [ ] Consistent with L2 containers (every container deployed somewhere)

## 7. Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] No spaghetti (too many crossing lines -- rearrange layout if more than 3 crossings)
- [ ] No inconsistent abstraction (mixing Systems and Components in one diagram)
- [ ] No technology overload (too much tech detail at L1 -- keep L1 abstract)
- [ ] No missing interfaces (components connecting without defined APIs)
- [ ] No distributed monolith appearance (tight coupling between supposedly independent services)
- [ ] No big ball of mud (unclear boundaries, everything connected to everything)
- [ ] No outdated documentation (diagrams match current codebase)

---

## 8. Readability and Scope Guidelines

Use the smallest set of elements that answers the question for the intended audience.
There is no C4-mandated element or component count. When a diagram becomes difficult to
scan, consider:
1. Splitting into multiple focused diagrams
2. Using boundary boxes to group related elements
3. Moving detail to a lower C4 level
4. Creating supplementary views for specific aspects
5. Drawing one view per service showing only its nearest inbound and outbound dependencies

Every split view stays at one abstraction level and tells part of the same story.
