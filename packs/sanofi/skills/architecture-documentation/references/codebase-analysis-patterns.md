## Service Boundary Detection

### Monorepo Pattern

In a monorepo, treat each runnable application or data-store responsibility as a
container candidate. Directory structure and deployment files are evidence; confirm
the runtime responsibility before adding it to the model.

```
project-root/
  packages/
    api/                    -> Container: API Service
      package.json          (has "scripts": { "start": ... })
      Dockerfile
      src/
    web-app/                -> Candidate: Web Application (client-side SPA)
      package.json          (has "react", "vite")
      src/
    worker/                 -> Container: Background Worker
      package.json          (has "start": "node worker.js")
      src/
    shared/                 -> NOT a container (shared library)
      package.json          (no "start" script, only "main"/"module")
      src/
  infrastructure/
    terraform/              -> Infrastructure definitions (candidate in-scope data stores)
      main.tf
      modules/
  docker-compose.yml        -> Maps containers for local dev
```

**Heuristics:**
- A directory with its own `package.json` and a `start` script or `Dockerfile` is evidence
  of a runnable container; confirm its runtime responsibility and system scope
- Shared libraries (`shared/`, `common/`, `utils/`) are NOT containers
- `docker-compose.yml` services can reveal runtime boundaries, but local development
  topology is not by itself the C4 model
- An image or build context can support a container classification; do not model helper
  services, build steps, or sidecars automatically

### Multi-Repo Pattern

When a system spans multiple repositories, do not equate repository boundaries with
service or system boundaries. Use repositories as evidence for runtime responsibility
and ownership, then model the resulting scope.

```
github.com/org/user-api       -> Candidate: User API
  package.json
  Dockerfile

github.com/org/user-web       -> Candidate: User Web App (SPA)
  package.json (react)

github.com/org/notification-service  -> Candidate: Notification Service
  package.json
  Dockerfile

github.com/org/infrastructure -> Not a container (Terraform definitions)
  terraform/
```

**Heuristics:**
- A repo with a `Dockerfile` or deployment config is evidence of one or more runnable
  containers, not a fixed one-repo-to-one-container rule
- Some repos may contain multiple containers (check for multiple Dockerfiles)
- Infrastructure repos define containers (databases, queues) as Terraform resources

**Cross-repo workspace detection:**

When the task supplies several local repository paths (for example from the user or an
optional workflow config such as `sanofi-code-workflow.yaml` with `github.repos`),
analysis strategy:

1. Analyze each repo independently using the same heuristics (Dockerfile, package.json, etc.)
2. Decide whether the repositories together form one software-system boundary before
   merging in-scope containers into an L2 view
3. Detect cross-repo relationships by matching:
   - API URLs / base paths referenced in one repo that match routes defined in another
   - Shared database names (same RDS instance, same DynamoDB table)
   - Shared queue names (same SQS queue name in producer and consumer repos)
   - Shared S3 bucket names
4. Infrastructure repos provide evidence for in-scope data stores and managed services;
   classify each based on the documented system boundary and audience

```yaml
# Example optional workflow config: sanofi-code-workflow.yaml
github:
  repos:
    backend: ./user-api
    frontend: ./user-web
    infra: ./infrastructure

# Analysis result:
# ./user-api        -> Container: User API [Fastify / TypeScript]
# ./user-web        -> Container: User SPA [React / TypeScript] (client)
#                   -> Asset host/API only if a distinct in-scope runtime exists;
#                      Vite development tooling alone is not a server-side container
# ./infrastructure  -> Container: User DB [PostgreSQL / RDS]
#                   -> Container: User Cache [Redis / ElastiCache]
#                   -> Container: Event Queue [SQS]
```

### Serverless Consolidation Pattern

Multiple Lambda functions do NOT always mean multiple containers. Apply these consolidation
rules before creating the L2 diagram:

**Same container** (consolidate into ONE):
- Multiple Lambdas behind a **single API Gateway** sharing a database and codebase
- Multiple Lambdas in a **SAM template** or **serverless.yml** that form one logical service
- Multiple Lambdas in a **monorepo workspace** with shared ports/adapters/services layers

**Separate containers** (keep as individual):
- Lambdas with **independent deployment pipelines** and no shared API Gateway
- Lambdas with **different runtimes** (e.g., Node.js vs Python) serving different concerns
- Lambdas that are **action group tools** invoked by a managed orchestration service

```
Consolidation heuristics:
  Single API Gateway + N Lambdas + shared DB    -> ONE container (the API service)
  SAM template.yml with grouped functions        -> Usually ONE container per logical service
  Lambda A (Node.js API) + Lambda B (Python ML)  -> TWO containers (different concerns)
  Lambda invoked only by Bedrock/Step Functions   -> Separate container (action group tool)
```

**Example**: A repo with 4 Lambda functions (studies, benchmark, feedback, migrations) behind
one API Gateway, all using the same PostgreSQL database and Drizzle ORM, is ONE container:
"Core API [Node.js / Hono]" -- not four.

### Managed Orchestration Services

Separate the provider platform from what you configure on it. Apply the boundary rule in
[c4-abstractions-guide.md](c4-abstractions-guide.md): in-scope runtime or data-store
responsibility → container; merely consumed → external system.

```
Provider platform (usually external, or omitted):
  AWS Bedrock, AWS Step Functions, EventBridge, AWS App Runner, CloudFront

Configured by you and in scope (container when its responsibility matters to the view):
  Your Step Functions state machine  -> Container: order workflow [Step Functions]
  Your App Runner service            -> Container: your service [FastAPI / Python]
  Lambda function (your code)        -> Container: your service [Lambda / Python]
  ECS Fargate task (your app)        -> Container: your service [FastAPI / Python]
  Action group Lambda (tool)         -> Container: your tool [Lambda / Python]

Consumed but not owned (external system):
  Shared enterprise Bedrock agent, another team's workflow
```

**Key distinction**: Code or workflow definitions your team owns and deploys are in-scope
containers. The managed provider platform that runs them is not drawn as your container.

### Infrastructure-Defined Containers

Terraform and Kubernetes manifests define containers that code repositories depend on:

```hcl
# terraform/main.tf
module "rds" { ... }           -> Container: Database [PostgreSQL]
module "elasticache" { ... }   -> Container: Cache [Redis]
module "sqs" { ... }           -> Container: Queue [SQS]
module "s3_bucket" { ... }     -> Container: Object Store [S3]
module "lambda" { ... }        -> Container: see Serverless Consolidation Pattern above
module "dynamodb" { ... }      -> Container: Database [DynamoDB]
module "ecs_service" { ... }   -> Container: (application service)
module "ecr_repository" { ... } -> NOT a container (image registry)
```

```yaml
# kubernetes/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-api               -> Container: User API
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: user-api
          image: user-api:latest
```

---

## Data Flow Detection

Identify relationships between containers by searching for client/SDK usage patterns.

### HTTP Calls (REST, GraphQL)

```
Pattern                          -> Relationship
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
fetch('https://api.example.com') -> Sends requests to External: Example API [HTTP/REST]
axios.get('/api/users')          -> Fetches data from Internal API [HTTP/REST]
new ApolloClient({ uri })       -> Queries data from GraphQL API [HTTP/GraphQL]
httpClient.post('/orders')       -> Creates orders via API [HTTP/REST]
```

**What to search for:**
```
# Node.js / TypeScript
grep -r "fetch\|axios\|http\.get\|http\.post\|got\(" src/
grep -r "new ApolloClient\|gql\`" src/

# Python
grep -r "requests\.get\|requests\.post\|httpx\.\|aiohttp\." src/
```

### Database Queries

```
Pattern                          -> Relationship
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
import { Pool } from 'pg'       -> Reads/writes data [SQL/TCP] to PostgreSQL container
prisma.user.findMany()           -> Queries user data [Prisma/TCP] to database
drizzle.select().from(users)     -> Queries user data [Drizzle/TCP] to database
dynamoClient.send(new PutItemCommand) -> Stores data [AWS SDK] in DynamoDB container
mongoose.connect(MONGO_URI)      -> Reads/writes data [MongoDB Wire/TCP] to MongoDB
```

**What to search for:**
```
grep -r "new Pool\|PrismaClient\|drizzle\|mongoose\|DynamoDB\|DocumentClient" src/
grep -r "createConnection\|getRepository\|DataSource" src/  # TypeORM
```

### Message Queues

```
Pattern                          -> Relationship
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
sqs.sendMessage({ QueueUrl })    -> Publishes messages to Queue [SQS/HTTPS]
sqs.receiveMessage()             -> Consumes messages from Queue [SQS/HTTPS]
eventBridge.putEvents()          -> Emits events to Event Bus [EventBridge/HTTPS]
channel.publish(exchange, key)   -> Publishes messages to bound Queue via Exchange [AMQP]
producer.send({ topic })         -> Produces records to Topic [Kafka]
```

**Arrow style:** Use **dashed lines** for async message-based communication.

**Modeling rule:** The queue or topic is the container, not the broker. Resolve the queue/topic
name from config, IaC, or constants and name that container; NEVER draw one "Message Bus" hub
that every producer and consumer connects to. If the name cannot be resolved, say so and leave
the relationship unlabeled by queue rather than inventing one. See
[c4-abstractions-guide.md](c4-abstractions-guide.md).

### Cache Operations

```
Pattern                          -> Relationship
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
redis.get(key)                   -> Reads cached data [Redis/TCP]
redis.set(key, value)            -> Writes to cache [Redis/TCP]
memcached.get(key)               -> Reads cached data [Memcached/TCP]
```

### Object Storage

```
Pattern                          -> Relationship
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
s3.putObject({ Bucket, Key })    -> Stores files in Object Store [S3/HTTPS]
s3.getObject({ Bucket, Key })    -> Retrieves files from Object Store [S3/HTTPS]
s3.upload(params)                -> Uploads to Object Store [S3/HTTPS]
```

## External System Detection

External systems are identified by SDK usage, OAuth configuration, and third-party
API client patterns.

### Authentication Providers

```
Signal                            -> External System
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OIDC_ISSUER env var               -> Identity Provider (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)
passport.use(new OIDCStrategy())  -> Identity Provider
@azure/msal-node                  -> Azure Active Directory
AWS Cognito SDK                   -> AWS Cognito (Identity)
auth0 SDK                         -> Auth0 (Identity)
SAML2 config                      -> Enterprise SSO Provider
```

### Payment Services

```
Signal                            -> External System
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
stripe SDK / @stripe/stripe-js    -> Stripe (Payment Processing)
adyen SDK                         -> Adyen (Payment Processing)
paypal SDK                        -> PayPal (Payment Processing)
```

### Analytics and Monitoring

```
Signal                            -> External System
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dd-trace / datadog SDK            -> Datadog (Monitoring)
@sentry/node / Sentry.init()     -> Sentry (Error Tracking)
newrelic agent                    -> New Relic (APM)
@google-analytics / gtag          -> Google Analytics
amplitude SDK                     -> Amplitude (Product Analytics)
@opentelemetry/*                  -> OpenTelemetry Collector -> Observability Platform
```

### Email and Notification

```
Signal                            -> External System
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
nodemailer + SMTP config          -> Email Service (SMTP)
@sendgrid/mail                    -> SendGrid (Email)
AWS SES SDK                       -> AWS SES (Email)
twilio SDK                        -> Twilio (SMS/Voice)
firebase-admin (messaging)        -> Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push)
```

### CDN and Storage

```
Signal                            -> External System
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CloudFront distribution config    -> AWS CloudFront (external CDN, or an in-scope container if your team owns it and it matters to the view)
Akamai config                     -> Akamai (CDN)
```

## Technology Detection

Detect the technology stack to annotate C4 elements with the correct technology labels.

### Framework Detection (package.json)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "fastify": "^4.x"        -> [Fastify / TypeScript]
    "express": "^4.x"        -> [Express / TypeScript]
    "@nestjs/core": "^10.x"  -> [NestJS / TypeScript]
    "hono": "^4.x"           -> [Hono / TypeScript]
    "react": "^19.x"         -> [React 19]
    "next": "^14.x"          -> [Next.js / React]
    "vue": "^3.x"            -> [Vue 3]
  }
}
```

### ORM Detection

```
prisma (schema.prisma file)       -> ORM: Prisma
drizzle-orm (drizzle.config.ts)   -> ORM: Drizzle
typeorm (ormconfig, DataSource)   -> ORM: TypeORM
sequelize                         -> ORM: Sequelize
mongoose                          -> ODM: Mongoose (MongoDB)
```

### Runtime Detection

```
.nvmrc or .node-version          -> Node.js (specific version)
.python-version                   -> Python (specific version)
go.mod                            -> Go
Cargo.toml                        -> Rust
pom.xml / build.gradle            -> Java
```

## Worked Example: Mapping Code to C4

Given this directory structure:

```
my-service/
  apps/
    web/                       # React SPA
      package.json             # react, vite
      src/
    api/                       # Fastify backend
      package.json             # fastify, drizzle-orm, pg
      src/
        routes/
        services/
        repositories/
        middleware/
    worker/                    # Background processor
      package.json             # bullmq, pg
      src/
  infrastructure/
    terraform/
      main.tf                  # RDS PostgreSQL, SQS, S3, ElastiCache Redis
      modules/
  docker-compose.yml           # web, api, worker, postgres, redis
```
