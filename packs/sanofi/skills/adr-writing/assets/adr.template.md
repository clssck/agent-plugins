## Architecture Manifesto Alignment

[Required. Map the decision to the relevant principles from the
[Sanofi Architecture Manifesto](https://sanofi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIGASTD/pages/60467430731/Architecture+Manifesto).
List only the principles that this decision directly impacts — do not list all 10.]

| # | Principle | Alignment | Notes |
| - | --------- | --------- | ----- |
| [N] | [principle name] | Aligned / Partial / Tension | [brief explanation] |

The 10 manifesto principles are:

1. **User Centricity** — Design solutions that delight users; mobile-first / responsive
2. **Simplicity** — KISS; don't over-engineer; don't assume future requirements
3. **Technical Debt** — Track and eliminate debt; don't add features to obsolete platforms
4. **Quality by Design** — Shift-left; embed quality, security, privacy, resilience from the start
5. **Security and Privacy** — Least privilege; data stores never publicly accessible
6. **Decoupling** — Decouple for autonomy and agility; smart endpoints, dumb pipes; reusable APIs
7. **Data Focus** — Minimize point-to-point integrations; proper data governance; data in same cloud
8. **Performance and Monitoring** — Observability; alerts on critical indicators; measure to learn
9. **Automation** — Code everything; use pre-built templates; automate rebuilds
10. **Frugality** — Right-size resources; optimize run cost; monitor spend with threshold alerts

Use these verdicts:
- **Aligned**: The decision directly supports this principle.
- **Partial**: The decision partially supports but has trade-offs against this principle.
- **Tension**: The decision conflicts with this principle — explain the trade-off and why it's acceptable.

## Options Ruled Out

[Optional. Use when an option was considered but ruled out early due to technical
infeasibility, platform constraints, or other hard blockers — not just preference.
Include the reason and a documentation reference.]

### [Ruled-Out Option]

Not viable because [reason with documentation reference].

## Cost Annex

[Optional. Include when the decision involves infrastructure, cloud services, or tooling
with variable pricing. Source data from vendor pricing APIs where possible.]

### Component Pricing

| Component | Rate | Source |
| --------- | ---- | ------ |
| [item]    | [$/hr or $/mo] | [vendor pricing page URL] |

### Scenario Comparison

| Scenario | Option A | Option B | Option C |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [scenario 1] | $X/mo | $Y/mo | $Z/mo |
