# Cost Analysis

Use this reference when an ADR involves infrastructure, cloud services, or tooling with
variable pricing — applies to both write mode (Cost Annex) and review mode (cost verification).

## Methodology

1. **Identify the cost-bearing components** from the ADR's considered options. For each
   option, list every service, license, or resource that incurs cost.

2. **Research pricing for each component** — find the official pricing page or API of the
   vendor. Use `read` on the URL or `web_search`; use `bash` with `curl` only for pricing
   APIs. Cite source URL and retrieval date (pricing pages change without notice).
   State billing units (e.g., SQS bills send, receive, and delete requests, not messages),
   region, free tier, batching, retries, and shared costs excluded from the comparison.

3. **Build comparison tables** showing costs across configurations (e.g., instance sizes,
   worker counts, number of environments). Each row should trace back to a cited source.

4. **Model multi-scenario projections** (e.g., 5, 10, 15 teams) to show how costs scale.
   Choose scenarios that match the decision drivers in the ADR.

5. **Provide both wide-format and long-format tables** — wide for readability, long for
   Confluence Chart macro compatibility.

6. **Include a Confluence Chart macro snippet** if the user intends to publish to Confluence:

   ```text
   {chart:type=bar|title=Cost Comparison|yLabel=Monthly Cost (USD)}
   || || Option A || Option B ||
   | Scenario 1 | 1000 | 2000 |
   {chart}
   ```

## Source Requirements

- Every cost figure must cite its origin (pricing page URL, API query, or vendor quote).
- When a pricing API is available, prefer it over static page scraping.
- When no public pricing exists (e.g., enterprise-negotiated rates), note the figure as
  "estimate — confirm with vendor" and flag it in the review.
