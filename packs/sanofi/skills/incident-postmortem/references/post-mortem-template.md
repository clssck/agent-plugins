# Post-Mortem Template

Copy this file to `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md` where the date
is the **incident start date** and the slug describes the impact (e.g.,
`2026-04-28-checkout-500s.md`).

Every section marked **Required** must be filled. Optional sections may be
omitted if they have no content — do not leave `TBD` placeholders.

# Post-Mortem: Checkout 500 errors following orders-api v2.41.0

> This post-mortem is **blameless**: it examines systems and processes,
> not individuals.

## Header (Required)

> **Incident ID**: reuse the ID from your incident tracker (PagerDuty,
> ServiceNow, Opsgenie, Jira incident, etc.) so the post-mortem is
> linkable from the same ID the responders used live. If no tracker
> issued one, fall back to `INC-YYYY-MMDD-NNN` (start date + daily
> sequence).
>
> **Severity**: record both the **live severity** (set during the
> incident) and the **final severity** (after post-mortem review). If
> they differ, add a short reason. Do not reclassify down to dodge the
> 5-business-day post-mortem deadline.

## Summary (Required)

Two-to-four-sentence summary suitable for leadership and incident-review
meetings. Include: what broke, who was affected, how long it lasted, and
what the root cause was in one line.

> Between 14:07 and 15:36 UTC on 2026-04-28, approximately 8% of checkout
> requests returned HTTP 500 errors for users with legacy cart schemas
> (primarily EU paying customers who had not migrated). The outage was
> triggered by `orders-api` v2.41.0, which assumed a field populated only
> for post-migration carts. Rollback went live at 15:32 UTC and errors
> returned to baseline by 15:36 UTC; resolution with a forward fix landed
> at 15:47 UTC.

## Impact (Required)

Quantify wherever possible. If a number is unknown, say so — do not guess.

- **Users affected**: ~4,200 users (EU paying segment, ~6% of that
  segment's active users during the window).
- **Requests affected**: ~31,000 failed `/checkout` calls out of ~390,000
  (8.0% error rate at peak; baseline 0.1%).
- **Duration of customer impact**: 1h 29m (14:07 → 15:36 UTC, from
  first elevated errors to post-rollback recovery).
- **Revenue impact**: est. €48k in abandoned carts; confirmed via
  support ticket sampling, pending finance confirmation.
- **Data impact**: none — no writes were corrupted. Failed checkouts did
  not create partial orders.
- **Regulatory / compliance impact**: none (no PII exposure, no GDPR or
  SOx-relevant records affected).
- **Customer tickets filed**: 14 (all closed as "resolved after retry").

## Timeline (Required)

All times UTC. Sources linked inline where available. Facts only — no
interpretation.

## Root Cause (Required)

### 5 Whys

1. **Why did `/checkout` return 500s?**
   `CartHydrator` threw `NullPointerException` when hydrating legacy carts.
2. **Why did the hydrator hit null?**
   v2.41.0 assumed every cart has `pricing_context.region`, which is only
   populated for carts created after the Feb 2026 schema migration.
3. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?**
   Unit and integration test fixtures only include post-migration carts.
   No legacy cart shape is represented in any fixture.
4. **Why didn't the canary detect it?**
   The canary router sends traffic from new accounts only (a 2023 default
   for rollout safety), and new accounts do not have legacy carts.
5. **Why is the canary router segmented this way?**
   The 2023 configuration was never revisited after the 2026 schema
   migration changed the risk profile.

### Contributing Factors

Root cause is rarely a single chain. Capture **all** factors that had to
align for this incident to occur:

- **Trigger**: v2.41.0 dereferenced `pricing_context.region` without null
  guard.
- **Gap — test coverage**: no legacy-cart fixture in any test suite.
- **Gap — canary traffic segmentation**: canary does not represent
  legacy-schema traffic, so pre-production signal was absent.
- **Gap — alert threshold**: `/checkout` 5xx alert fires at 10% error
  rate; incident peaked at 8% and never paged. Support escalation was
  the only detection path.
- **Gap — rollback runbook**: no documented rollback procedure for
  `orders-api` > v2.40. @bob reconstructed the procedure live.

## What Went Well

- Rollback was clean and fully mitigated impact within 4 minutes of
  deploy.
- @bob's decision at 15:12 to stop waiting for the forward fix and roll
  back was the right call; TTM would have been 25+ min longer otherwise.
- Support and oncall communication in Slack was tight; no confusion
  about who owned what.
- No data corruption; failed checkouts failed cleanly.

## What Went Wrong

- The error-rate alert threshold was too loose; detection relied on
  customer support rather than on monitoring.
- The canary process gave false confidence — the segmentation meant the
  bug was never observable in canary traffic.
- No rollback runbook; the IC had to improvise.
- Test fixtures did not represent production's actual data shape
  diversity.

## Where We Got Lucky

- The `/checkout` endpoint fails cleanly on this error; retries succeed
  once the cart state is refreshed. A similar bug on an asynchronous
  path could have left partial orders in an inconsistent state.
- The incident began during EU business hours; detection by support
  escalation happened within 11 minutes. At 03:00 UTC on a weekend the
  alert gap would have let the incident run for hours.

## Action Items (Required)

Every action item must have owner (a named person, never a role, rotation,
or team), absolute deadline, tracking link, priority (P0/P1/P2), and type
(`prevent`, `detect`, `mitigate`, `process`, `documentation`). If no
individual has accepted an item yet, write `UNASSIGNED` in Owner, leave
the real tracking link blank rather than inventing one, and keep the
post-mortem in **Draft** until every row is complete.

| 5   | Write rollback runbook for `orders-api` covering v2.40+ schema changes.                                         | documentation | @bob        | 2026-05-14 | P1       | ENG-1238 |
| 6   | Add deploy-gate check: block rollout when canary error rate > baseline + 2σ.                                    | mitigate      | @carol      | 2026-06-04 | P2       | ENG-1239 |

## Lessons Learned

- **Canary segmentation is a silent assumption.** A canary that doesn't
  represent production traffic gives false confidence. Audit canary
  routing whenever data-model assumptions change.
- **Alert thresholds are written for past traffic, not present risk.**
  The 10% threshold was set when baseline error rate was 1%. With a 0.1%
  baseline it is too loose by 100x.
- **Rollback is a feature; test and document it.** The absence of a
  rollback runbook adds minutes of IC cognitive load during exactly the
  moments when speed matters most.
- **Fixture diversity lags schema reality.** Every migration should
  include a fixture-update checklist item.
