# Action Items Tracker (skeleton)

Copy into an issue tracker or spreadsheet used alongside the post-mortem.
Every row must have owner (named person), absolute deadline (YYYY-MM-DD),
priority, type, and tracking link before the post-mortem is considered
complete.

| #   | Description | Type | Owner | Deadline | Priority | Tracking | Status |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1   |             |      |       |          |          |          | open   |
| 2   |             |      |       |          |          |          | open   |
| 3   |             |      |       |          |          |          | open   |

**Type** is one of: `prevent`, `detect`, `mitigate`, `process`,
`documentation`.

**Priority** is one of: `P0` (fix now), `P1` (fix this sprint), `P2` (fix
this quarter).

A post-mortem whose action items are all `prevent` is incomplete — add at
least one `detect` item (catch-it-sooner) and consider a `mitigate` item
(shrink-blast-radius) so the next occurrence is also easier to handle.
